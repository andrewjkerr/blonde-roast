STATUS: Passing
VERSION: 0.1

*What is Roast?*
Roast is a one stop shop for your resume website needs! There are currently three planned versions of Roast:
	1) Blonde (Hey, that's this one!): Insert your information into the webform and Blonde-Roast will generate your code!
	2) Medium (Planned): A hosted version of Roast CMS! Allows users to use the features of Dark without their own server.
	3) Dark (In Progress): Host a version of Roast CMS yourself! Includes a backend for easy updating.
	
*What do I need for Roast?*
Well, you'll obviously need the file(s), but you'll also need Bootstrap which can be found here: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/. The Bootstrap folder should be named "bootstrap" and be placed wherever you're placing Roast.

*What now?*
I've got a list of things that I'd like to add/change, but this is just a first version. I wanted to get something working correctly then move on to other features! :)
