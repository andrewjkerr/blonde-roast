**BLONDE ROAST**
================

Blonde Roast is the open sourced versions of Roast. You can find Blonde Roast at http://www.andrewjkerr.com/roast/blonde. You can see an example output (with modifications) at http://cise.ufl.edu/~akerr.

*What is Roast?*
----------------
Roast is a static page generator made for resumes that uses (Boostrap)[http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/] to make it easy for edits later on. Blonde Roast is the open sourced generator while Roast (WIP) is closed source and allows users to log in and edit their information.
	
*What do I need for Roast?*
---------------------------
Well, you'll obviously need the HTML output from Blonde Roast, but you'll also need Bootstrap which can be found here: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/. The Bootstrap folder should be named "bootstrap" and be placed wherever you're placing Blonde Roast.

*What now?*
-----------
I've got a list of things that I'd like to add/change, but this is just a first version. I wanted to get something working correctly then move on to other features! :)
